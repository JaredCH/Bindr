## 📊 Historical Metrics Architecture – SQL + WinForms

This system is designed to track and visualize changes over time in a high-volume job environment, using SQL Server for storage and a WinForms application for reporting.

### 🗃️ SQL Implementation Overview

- **Event Tracking Table**  
  A dedicated `SupportEvents` table logs every meaningful change (e.g., new row added, status change, quantity/revenue changes) with timestamps.

- **Efficient Indexing**  
  Time-based and job-based indexes allow fast querying, even with tens of thousands of rows per job.

- **Optional: Daily Summary Table**  
  To optimize reporting performance, nightly jobs can summarize key metrics (e.g., total supports, total revenue per status/job/date).

- **Scalability Strategy**  
  Event tables stay lean because they record only deltas, not snapshots. Historical trends are derived from events, reducing table bloat.

### 💻 WinForms Integration

- **Data Queries**  
  Your app queries for specific ranges (e.g., last 7, 30, 90 days), grouping by date/week/month, job, or status.

- **Graphing**  
  Load queried data into chart controls to show trends like:
  - Running total of supports per job
  - Revenue completed per week/month
  - Status transitions over time

- **Performance**  
  With smart indexing and scoped queries, even high-volume jobs return results quickly and reliably in WinForms.

### ✅ Why This Works

- Supports detailed, time-based reporting without bloating the core tables.
- Enables easy visualization of operational trends.
- Scales with your business — from hundreds to millions of changes.
- Plays well with existing SQL infrastructure and WinForms tooling.
