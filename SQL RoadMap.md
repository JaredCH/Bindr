🧱 SQL Side (Database Design & Processing)
Event Tracking Table
You’ll create a simple table that logs every time something important happens — like when a support is added or changes status.
Each entry includes:

The support ID

The job it belongs to

The status it changed from and to

The type of event

A timestamp

This Doesn’t Replace Your Main Data
Your main tables still hold the current state. This event table just tracks changes over time. Think of it as an activity log.

Indexes to Keep It Fast
You’d add indexes to this table on columns like JobId and Timestamp so that when you query recent history or a specific job, it’s quick.

Optional Aggregation
If querying historical changes becomes too slow (because the event table gets huge), you can run a background process each night to summarize the day’s data into a separate summary table. That table is much smaller and easier to query quickly.

🖥️ WinForms Side (How Your App Gets the Data)
Query for Specific Timeframes
When the user wants to see trends (like changes per day or supports added per week), your app sends a query asking the SQL Server to group the historical data by day, week, or month.

Pull Only What You Need
You’re not loading the entire event log. You just pull data for the time range and jobs you care about (e.g., the last 30 days for Job 1234).

Display It in Charts or Tables
Your app loads that grouped data and shows it in line graphs, bar charts, or tables — whatever you prefer.

Performance is Fine
For your scale (10–15 jobs, 100–1000 changes/day), SQL Server will handle this easily if you index correctly and don’t try to pull the entire table at once. For most day-to-day use, it’ll be fast enough to feel smooth in your app.
